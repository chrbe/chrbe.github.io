# Cycle Sync Calculator

#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:

This website serves to inform women the phase of the menstrual cycle which they are presently in.

Motivation to create this website stems from personal experience where living as a woman is tough. To help myself and all women live the most productive way we can, the menstrual cycle which contributes to our neurochemistry and mental state daily, not only
when we are menstruating, certainly affects the way we live our lives, and of course the pursuit of our dreams.

Therefore, it would be extremely beneficial to us women to sync our menstrual cycles with our daily lives, to enable us to excel while our body and mental state is the best at various tasks at various phases.

Although each woman have variable menstrual cycle days, I have given an averaged number of days for each phases based on my research. A future improvement of this project could be additonal questions, such as asking "how frequent is your menstruation" or
"how long does your menstruation last" to fine tune the number of days for each phase such that the calculation of each phase could be personalized.
By providing the start of your menstruation, an average of 7 days is taken to calculate this menstruation phase.
Next, follicular phase is calculated to last around an average 14 days while overlapping with menstruation. This is how follicular.html is generated.
Ovulation averages for 1-4 days and an average of 2 days was taken, which generates ovulation.html.
Lastly, luteal phase is the longest phase, an average of 14 days were taken to calculate this phase (luteal.html).
A catch all webpage(err.html) was added should the length of the menstrual cycle up till today's date had already exceeded 1 month(30 days).
An averaged 28 day menstrual cycle was not assumed.

Personally, instead of designing the webpage with various shades between pink and red, I preferred to choose a simple, neutral coloured webpage to dissociate with the stereotypical colours and perceptions of menstrual cycle, in a bid to normalize cycle syncing and provide
a comfortable viewing experience.
